This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust programming: data races caused by multiple mutable references to the same variable.  The `bug.rs` file contains code that exhibits this issue. The `bugSolution.rs` file offers a corrected version that avoids data races by using techniques like cloning or using a mutex.
